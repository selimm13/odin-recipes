        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Combine sausage, Cheddar cheese, almond flour, coconut flour, gelatin, egg, and baking powder in
                 a large bowl. Mix to combine using your hands, a stand mixer, or a food processor. Form mixture
                  into uniformly-sized balls (about 1 1/2-inch diameter) and place on the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 23 to 28 minutes. Remove sausage balls and let
                 cool on the pan until oil is reabsorbed, about 5 minutes.</li>
