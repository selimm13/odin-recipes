        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Snickerdoodles are soft, slightly tangy cookies coated in cinnamon-sugar. Because they're rolled and 
            covered in cinnamon-sugar, snickerdoodles tend to have a cracked appearance when they're fully baked. 
            Nobody quite knows where the cookie got its name, but some speculate it comes from ​​"schneckennudel" 
            (a cinnamon-spiked German dessert).</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Beat the sugar, butter, shortening, eggs, and vanilla together. Mix the flour, 
                cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, then
                 stir until well-combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll the dough:</strong> Shape the dough into walnut-sized balls. Roll each ball in cinnamon-sugar until 
                they're all evenly coated.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the cookies:</strong> Bake the cookies in a preheated oven until they're set, but not too hard. 
                Cool on a wire rack.</li>
