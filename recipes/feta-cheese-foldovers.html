        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, blend feta cheese, green onions, and egg. Cut pastry into 12 (3 inch) squares. 
                Place a mounded tablespoon of feta mixture in the center of each square. Moisten edges with water, 
                and fold pastry over filling to form a triangle. Press edges together firmly with a fork to seal. 
                Lightly brush pastries with the egg yolk mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
